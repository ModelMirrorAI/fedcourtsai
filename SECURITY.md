# Security

## Principles enforced in this repo

- **Pin actions to a full commit SHA**, with the version in a trailing comment.
  `zizmor` (in `lint-actions.yml`) fails the build on unpinned actions; Dependabot
  bumps the pins.
- **Least-privilege permissions.** Every workflow sets top-level `permissions: {}`
  and grants only what each job needs.
- **No static key in the runner's process env where untrusted code runs.** The
  Codex action proxies `OPENAI_API_KEY` so the CLI never holds it; the Claude
  action handles `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` similarly. The lower-sensitivity
  CourtListener token is passed as a scoped step env only where needed.
- **Label triggers are maintainer-gated** — only users with triage/write access
  can apply labels, which is the trust boundary for `run:*`.
- **Prompt-injection awareness.** Issue bodies are untrusted input. The agent
  actions (`anthropics/claude-code-action`) include actor-permission checks and are
  the supported path for issue-triggered runs; matrix inputs are parsed from a
  fixed JSON block rather than free text, and agents are instructed to treat docket
  text as data, not instructions.
- **`persist-credentials: false`** on read-only checkouts.
- **Secrets are never written to `data/` or logs.** The `validate` gate and review
  on every agent PR are the backstops.
