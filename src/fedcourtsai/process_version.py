"""The process-version stamp and the frozen-headline partition.

A prediction/evaluation is stamped with the *process* that produced it — the
prompt template, the resolved registry config for the actor, and the harness
commit — so headline metrics can reflect only the frozen, blessed process and
exclude the July/August shakedown runs without deleting them. Same doctrine as
``sal-v1`` (:data:`fedcourtsai.pipeline.salience.SALIENCE_VERSION`): a process
change is a *new* version, never an in-place edit, so any past ranking always
replays against the process that produced it.

Hybrid identity. The partition key is a content ``digest`` of the actual process
inputs, so a silent prompt or config change is automatically a distinct version;
``label`` is human-readable sugar. ``pipeline_sha`` is provenance only and is
deliberately excluded from the digest — see :class:`fedcourtsai.schemas.ProcessVersion`.

The freeze is a **future, explicit** event. :data:`FROZEN_PROCESS_DIGESTS` is
empty until a one-line "freeze commit" blesses the digest(s) a maintainer reads
off ``fedcourts process-digest --all``. Until then the frozen headline is
legitimately empty — there is no frozen-process data yet.
