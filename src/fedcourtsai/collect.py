"""Path-jail guardrail and per-run PR aggregation for the matrix stages.

The predict/evaluate/reconcile stages fan out one matrix cell per
predictor/evaluator x case x event and used to open one PR per cell — dozens a
day, each merged by hand. They now aggregate: every cell uploads its ``data/``
output as a build artifact, and a single ``collect`` job unions them into **one
PR per run** that auto-merges once the required checks are green.

Because that PR merges without a human, two controls keep it honest, and both
live here as small pure functions the CLI wraps so the YAML only runs git/gh:

- The **path jail** (:func:`assert_within_jail`): an auto-merged data PR may only
  *add* files under ``data/``. Anything else — a touched workflow, a modified or
  deleted artifact, a write into another run's directory — is rejected. It runs
  producer-side in the ``collect`` job (before the commit) and again as a required
  status check on the PR, so the guarantee holds independently of the workflow
  that produced the branch.
- The **collect plan** (:func:`collect_plan`): partitions a run's cells into the
  ready set (one auto-merging PR) and the partial set (a failed or invalid
  agent's output, opened as a single *draft* PR a maintainer finishes — a draft
  never auto-merges), and builds the branch, commit message, PR title, and body.
